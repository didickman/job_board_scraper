This program scrapes hedge funds/ trading companies/ asset managers/ etc. careers page
with the goal of automating the process of scanning for newly posted jobs.

The first time you run this, it will simply create hidden files with the pattern .<company_abbreviation>
for each company containing all of the jobs on their careers page. The next time you run it, it will 
compare the jobs returned from the new scrape to the old hidden files, and print any new jobs for each
company to the terminal. It will also create a file in the directory, in the directory in which you ran
the program, called 'new_jobs'. This new file will contain the exact text that's printed to the terminal,
and it will be re-written each time you run the program.

I am going to be consistently adding new companies to this, and may add new functionality/ features
as I come up with them/ develop them.
